Tcl Huddle Package
==================

``huddle`` is a Tcl package that implements a typed dictionary-like data structure.
Its official code is a part of the ``yaml`` module in Tcllib.

This is a forked version, which is to provide the ``huddle`` structure independent
of Tcllib. It is meant for cases where custom Tcl interpreters come without Tcllib,
which is quite frequent for EDA (Electronic Design Automation) tools.
